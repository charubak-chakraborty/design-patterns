package observer

// Observer is a behavioral design pattern that allows some objects to notify other objects about changes in their state.

// In the e-commerce website, items go out of stock from time to time. There can be customers who are interested in a particular item that went out of stock. There are three solutions to this problem:

// The customer keeps checking the availability of the item at some frequency.
// E-commerce bombards customers with all new items available, which are in stock.
// The customer subscribes only to the particular item he is interested in and gets notified if the item is available. Also, multiple customers can subscribe to the same product.
// Option 3 is most viable, and this is what the Observer pattern is all about. The major components of the observer pattern are:

// Subject, the instance which publishes an event when anything happens.
// Observer, which subscribes to the subject events and gets notified when they happen.
